# docker-flask-boilerplate
## What 
A container-based boilerplate for flask applications. 

# Getting Started
- Clone
- docker-compose up --build
- Visit http://localhost:8080
- Access API calls directly with http://localhost:8080/api/hello

# Disclaimer:
This template was created as I learned containerization and their best practices; I am still adding improvements over time. In the meantime, use at your own discretion.


TODOS:
- Handle CSRF between React and Flask form submissions
